Ising Model Computational Physics simulation

- Ising2D-regular.ipynb is a iPython notebook used to apply the Metropolis algorithm on a 2D square lattice. This also plots physical observables as a function of temperature $[J/k_B]$

- IsingClass.py is a module written to store all the relavant functions called to implement out analysis on the different lattices.
