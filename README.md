# Ising
Ising Model Computational Physics simulation

- Ising2D-regular.ipynb is a iPython notebook used to apply the Metropolis algorithm on a 2D square lattice. This also plots physical observables as a function of temperature [J/k_B].

- IsingClass.py is a module written to store all the relavant functions called to implement out analysis on the different lattices.

- Ising_triangular.ipynb = Ising triangular lattice, just started.
- 1D Ising.ipynb = basically Ising2D-regular.ipynb applied in whole setting the y-dimensions of the lattice to unity.
